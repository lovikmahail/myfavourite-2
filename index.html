    <p id = "p1">My Favourite Hobby is Reading Story Books.</p>
    <p id ="p2">It is wisely said that books are our first best friends or companions. They are our best friends because they demand nothing from us and help us learn various lessons of life. Books give us plenty of joy and amusement. As story books are intresting and attract us, they tell us the morals for the life. I love story books.</p>
